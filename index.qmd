I'm now a PhD Candidate in the Economics Department at ESSEC Business School, and the THEMA lab. My supervisor is Prof. Jamus Jerome Lim. My research interests lie in the field of International Trade and related topics in the Applied Microeconomics. I focus on the reverse "China Syndrome" on Chinese Labour market and regional innovations. Also, my coauthor and I are working on topics about the trade consequences by Chinese foreign aid, and firm level patents citation & networks.
